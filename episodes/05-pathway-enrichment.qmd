## Enrichment analysis of gene lists

We want to assign some sort of funtion or pathway to a cluster / list of genes. To do this we can use GO term enrichment.

**TODO**:

- Add description to do this in a webserver e.g. [g:profiler](http://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost). Seems up to date and also looks like it contains many different organisms. 
- Add instructions to do this in code via `clusterProfiler`
- The example dataset is from Arabidopsis but preferably the instructions and code should work for a wide range of organisms, such that the instructions are easily usable for anyone.
