We could examine this list manually and look for our favorite genes of interest. However, the power of RNA-seq is that we can move beyond a simple analysis of a few genes and start to understand which processes or pathways are involved in the response to your treatments. To do this, we will use overrepresentation analysis (ORA) of Gene Ontology (GO) terms.\n\n## What is a GO term exactly?\n\nGO terms offer a standardized way of describing gene functions and the biological processes they participate in. For example, a GO term could be: `nucleotide binding` or `response to biotic stress`. GO terms come in three categories:\n\n- **Biological Process (BP)** \n- **Molecular Function (MF)**\n- **Cellular Component (CC)**\n\n## What is an overrepresentation analysis exactly?\n\nIn the R package that we will use, ORA uses a *hypergeometric* test to determine whether a particular GO term is enriched in your list of genes. Conceptually, it answers the following question:\n\n> Given my background list of genes, are genes annotated to this GO term observed more often in my input gene list than expected by chance?\n\nThe background list of genes, sometimes called the 'universe' in ORA jargon, is important. Naively, one could decide to use all genes present in annotation of your organism as universe. However, the universe is defined as all the genes that were elegible to be tested for differential expression. For an RNA-seq experiment, this means that genes that were not detected in any of your samples should be removed from the background universe for ORA. \n\n## Let's get started\n\nIn case you continued directly from the previous episode, you will only need to load a few more packages. `clusterProfiler` is the main package for enrichment analysis in R, extensively documented [here](https://yulab-smu.top/biomedical-knowledge-mining-book/02-Enrichment.html). `org.At.tair.db` is a database containing functional annotation for *Arabidopsis thaliana* (At). Functional annotations are available  for several model organisms such as *Homo sapiens* (`org.Hs.tair.db`), see [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Organism) for all available organisms.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(clusterProfiler)\nlibrary(org.At.tair.db)\nlibrary(enrichplot)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn case you didn't manage to finish the previous episode, or you're starting here for other reasons, you can run the following code to get back to the starting point of this episode by running:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code to get to the starting point of this episode\"}\nset.seed(1992)\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(DESeq2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(clusterProfiler)\nlibrary(org.At.tair.db)\nlibrary(enrichplot)\n\n# Read the data\nraw_counts <- read.csv(\"data/GLDS38_raw_counts.csv\", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F) \nraw_counts <- raw_counts %>% column_to_rownames(\"gene\") \nmetadata <- read.csv(\"data/samples_to_condition.csv\", header = T)\n\n# Generate DDS object and run DESeq function:\ndds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = raw_counts, \n                              colData = metadata, \n                              design = ~ condition)\n\ndds <- DESeq(dds)\n\n# Run DEG analysis\nres <- results(dds, alpha = 0.05)\n\nresults <- res %>%    # <3>\n  as.data.frame() %>% \n  rownames_to_column(\"genes\") %>%\n  arrange(padj)\n\n# Define significantly upregulated and downregulated genes with LFC and padj cutoffs\nlfc_cutoff <- 1\npadj_cutoff <- 0.05\n\n# Make new categorical variable containing significance information\nresults <- results %>% \n        mutate(significance = case_when(\n          padj < padj_cutoff & log2FoldChange > lfc_cutoff ~ 'Significantly upregulated',\n          padj < padj_cutoff & log2FoldChange < -lfc_cutoff ~ 'Significantly downregulated',\n          padj < padj_cutoff ~ 'Significant but small effect size',\n          TRUE ~ 'Not significant'\n        ))\n\nDEGs_list <- results %>% filter(significance == \"Significantly upregulated\" | significance == \"Significantly downregulated\") %>% pull(genes)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLet's remind ourselves of what our list of genes of interest now looks like.

At least, we will sleep better tonight, knowing that we performed a statiscally sound ORA.\n\n:::\n\n## KEGG enrichment\n\nKEGG terms describe gene functions at the level of *pathways*. While there will be quite some overlap with GO terms, it can happen that KEGG terms happen to describe what's happening in your data a bit more clearly. Running and visualizing KEGG enrichment works very similar as GO term enrichment, but first we will need to find the 'KEGG code' of the organism we are studying, by searching by the scientific name.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkegg_result <- search_kegg_organism('Arabidopsis thaliana', by='scientific_name')\nhead(kegg_result)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    kegg_code      scientific_name common_name\n565       ath Arabidopsis thaliana thale cress\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAha, the KEGG code of *Arabidopsis thaliana* is `ath`.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nKEGG_result <- enrichKEGG(gene = DEGs_list,\n                                universe = universe_list,\n                                organism = \"ath\",\n                                minGSSize = 10,\n                                maxGSSize = 500,\n                                pAdjustMethod = \"BH\",\n                                qvalueCutoff = 0.05,\n                                use_internal_data = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nReading KEGG annotation online: \"https://rest.kegg.jp/link/ath/pathway\"...\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nReading KEGG annotation online: \"https://rest.kegg.jp/list/pathway/ath\"...\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndotplot(KEGG_result, x = \"FoldEnrichment\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05-pathway-enrichment_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis)\n\nIn the GO and KEGG ORA sections, we started with a *binary* gene list, that is, 'significant' vs 'not significant'. GSEA is another enrichment test that employs a different strategy. Here, we start with a *ranked list* of all the genes in our experiment. They might be ranked by Log2FoldChange, or adjusted p-value. Then, GSEA answers the following conceptual question:\n\n> Are genes from a pathway consistently found toward the top or bottom of the ranked list?\n\nIn other words, ORA requires us to make a choice about a threshold of significance and/or fold change, while GSEA is a 'threshold free' method.\n\nFirst, we will prepare the data structure to perform GSEA:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngene_list <- results$log2FoldChange # <1>\nnames(gene_list) <- results$genes # <2>\n\ngene_list <- gene_list[!is.na(gene_list)] # <3>\ngene_list <- sort(gene_list, decreasing = TRUE) # <4>\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n1. First, we take all the fold change values and store it in a list\n2. Then, we add the gene IDs as `names` of the list items\n3. We remove all entries where there was no valid fold change values (`NA`)\n4. Then, we sort the list.\n\nLet's now run the GSEA:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngsea_go <- gseGO(\n  geneList     = gene_list,\n  OrgDb        = org.At.tair.db,\n  keyType      = \"TAIR\",\n  ont          = \"BP\",\n  minGSSize    = 10,\n  maxGSSize    = 500,\n  pvalueCutoff = 0.05,\n  verbose      = FALSE\n)\n\ngseaplot2(\n  gsea_go,\n  geneSetID = 1, # <1>\n  title = gsea_go@result$Description[1]\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05-pathway-enrichment_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n1. By picking `1` here, we will plot the GO term with the lowest p-value. Make sure to explore a few more than just the first one, by changing the `1` to other numbers. You can inspect all significant GO terms in table format by using `summary(gsea_go)`.\n\nThis graph is rather complex but very interesting! Let's break the most important parts down:\n\n- The green line shows the *Running Enrichment Score*, and the highest point is enrichment score of this GO category. If the peak is at the left, this pathway is enriched among up-regulated genes. \n- Each vertical *tick* represents one gene from this GO term. So, there is clustering of (in this case) photosynthesis annotated genes in the top end of the ranked list.\n\n## Performing enrichment analysis on webservers\n\nSome people find it easier to use webservers for GO term enrichment. Of course, that's also possible. For example, [g:Profiler](http://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost) is an excellent webserver where you can simply paste a list of geneIDs, select your organism of study, hit `Run query`, and visually inspect the results. One big advantage of this webserver is that it contains GO annotations of hundreds of organisms, including many that are not available on `Bioconductor` for R-based analysis.\n\n## Concluding remarks\n\nThis concludes the bioDSC workshop on RNA-seq. We went all the way from experimental design to mapping reads to differential gene expression in `R`. If you want to practice more with existing datasets, continue to the next episode. \n",
