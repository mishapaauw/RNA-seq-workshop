Let's go through the setup for this RNA-seq workshop here.\n\n## From reads to alignments\n\nThis part is the 'hardcore' bioinformatics part of this workshop. These steps are nearly always performed using **command-line programs**, which can be accessed via the Terminal (macOS, Linux) or WSL (Windows). For this workshop, we prepared a Google Colab environment where we will run the commands. Access to the Google Colab environment requires a Google account.\n    \n* [Find the google colab here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jR2Og_qrUVg-VXNsfqJc5eEILcqHJYAC?usp=share_link) \n\nIn reality, you will often have so many samples and reads that you will need access to a compute cluster with more compute power (CPUs), working memory (RAM), and storage space. At the University of Amsterdam, we use [Crunchomics](https://crunchomics-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Crunchomics comes with many popular bioinformatics pre-installed, additional programs can be installed using `conda`.\n\n## Differential gene expression with DESeq2\n\nFor this part of the workshop, we will use `R`. Please make sure you have `R` and `RStudio` installed on your computer. In addition, you will need to install the following packages, via two different routes:\n\nInstall the following packages via `install.packages()`\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages('tidyverse')\ninstall.packages('patchwork')\ninstall.packages(\"pheatmap\")\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nInstall the following packages via `Bioconductor`\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBiocManager::install(\"apeglm\")\nBiocManager::install(\"clusterProfiler\")\nBiocManager::install(\"org.At.tair.db\")\nBiocManager::install(\"DESeq2\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTest whether `DESeq2` was installed properly by loading it:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell filename='R'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(DESeq2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nDuring the workshop, we will **not** have time to install the packages, or to troubleshoot installation problems. Please try to install the packages before the workshop. You can always contact the [workshop organizers](https://www.biodsc.nl/people.html) if you run into problems.\n\n## Getting the data\n\nThe data that will be used in this workshop can be found in the  [following Github repository](https://github.com/mishapaauw/RNA-seq-workshop-materials).",
