Our goal is to find out from which genes these reads originate, and whether there are differentially expressed genes between your experimental factors. Before doing that, we need to make sure that the sequencing reads are of good quality, a process called quality control (QC). Additionally, no matter how good the overall quality of the sequencing data is, we will also 'trim' our reads to remove bad quality reads and sequencing adapters that may still be present in the sample. So, to summarize, we will do the following steps in this episode:\n\n1. Quality control: is my sequencing data of *good quality*?\n2. Trimming: removing bad quality reads and sequencing adapters\n3. Mapping: where in the genome do these reads come from? \n4. Counting: how many reach originate from each gene?\n\nThe commands in this episode are to be executed in a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jR2Og_qrUVg-VXNsfqJc5eEILcqHJYAC?usp=share_link) associated to this workshop. We will use some basic terminal commands. You don't need to understand every command, rather, the goal is to become familiar with RNA-seq concepts and steps.\n\n\nThe first step in the RNA-seq workflow is to assess the quality of the sequencing reads. Sequence reads generated from next-generation sequencing technologies come in the FASTQ file format. This file format evolved from FASTA: it contains sequence data, but also contains quality information. For a single record (sequence read) there are four lines, each of which are described below:\n\n|Line|Description|\n|----|-----------|\n|1|Always begins with '@' and then information about the read|\n|2|The actual DNA sequence|\n|3|Always begins with a '+' and sometimes the same info in line 1|\n|4|Has a string of characters which represent the quality scores; must have same number of characters as line 2|\n\nLet's look at one read. Note that our `.fastq` files are compressed: they have extension `.fastq.gz`. Most bioinformatics programs can deal with compressed file, so we don't need to uncompress them. To have a look at a compressed file on the command line, we can use `zcat` and then pipe (`|`) the result into the `head` function to display the first 4 lines:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nzcat reads/sample1.fastq.gz | head -n 4\n\n@ERR1406259.2 HWI-ST1034:108:D1HW4ACXX:1:1101:1627:2208/1\nCCGAAACAATCTCTCTCTCGTCGCCGGAAGCAAAAGAAGAATTAAGATAAGCCTCATCCATCCAGTGATGCAAATCACCAACCCATATGGTTTTATTCTCA\n+\nCCCFFFFFHHHHHJJJIJJGIIIJJJFJJJJJJJIJIIGIIIJJJHIJJJHGHHHFFEFFFEDEEACDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDED4@BDDDDDEDC\n```\n\nThe fourth line of each read represent the quality score of each basecall, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score#Symbols) for more info. `fastqc` will use these characters to quantify the quality your read set.\n\nLet's run `fastqc` on one sample:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nmkdir fastqc_reports # <1>\nfastqc -o fastqc_reports reads/sample1.fastq.gz # <2>\n```\n\n1. First we make a directory (`mkdir`) to store the `fastqc` reports.\n2. We call the `fastqc` program, tell it to store the output in the fastqc_reports directory, and tell it which sample to use.\n\nYou'll see that `fastqc` created a `.html` page in the `fastqc_reports` directory. We'll inspect it later.\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nRun `fastqc` on another sample.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\nTo do this, we need to replace the input filename.\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nfastqc -o fastqc_reports reads/sample2.fastq.gz\n```\n:::\n\nDoing this manually for every sample would be quite tiring, especially when we would have many samples. We will use a for loop, a fundamental programming concept, to automate this process for us:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nfor sample in reads/*.fastq.gz # <1>\ndo # <2>\n  fastqc -o fastqc_reports ${sample} # <3>\ndone\n```\n\n1. Here we define a variable `sample` that will subsequently get the values of all datasets matching the `reads/*.fastq.gz` statement, where `*` acts as a wildcard.\n2. `do` (and later `done`) define the start and the end of the for loop, respectively.\n2. Here we add the actual command that will be repeated for each sample, where `$sample` will subsequently be filled in with all of our four filenames.\n\n`fastq` generates reports of each sample in `.html` and `.zip` format:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nls fastqc_reports # <1>\n\nsample1_fastqc.html  sample2_fastqc.zip   sample4_fastqc.html\nsample1_fastqc.zip   sample3_fastqc.html  sample4_fastqc.zip\nsample2_fastqc.html  sample3_fastqc.zip\n```\n1. `ls` is a command to 'list' all the files present in a directory.\n\nFinally, let's inspect the QC results. If you are working in the Google Colab, you can browse the files in the workspace by clicking the directory symbol. Find `fastqc_reports` and download the `.html` files. You can open these in any browser. `fastqc` gives teach dataset a score (Pass, Warning, or Fail) on several different modules. All scores are reported in the **Summary**. The next section contains basic statistics like the number of reads, average sequence length, and the GC content. Generally it is a good idea to keep track of the total number of reads sequenced for each sample and to make sure the read length and GC content is as expected (based on what you know of your studied organism). One of the most important analysis modules is the **“Per base sequence quality”** plot. This plot provides the distribution of quality scores at each position in the read across all reads. This plot can alert us to whether there were any problems occuring during sequencing. For example, see a good and bad quality result below:\n\n![](../images/fastqc-good-bad.png)\n\nOther modules are discussed in detail [here](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-salmon/lessons/qc_fastqc_assessment.html). Note that nearly all sequencing datasets will show yellow warnings or red fails: `fastqc` is quite conservative. Additionally, the module \"Per base sequence content\" very often fails for RNA-seq data, as a result of RNA-seq library prep. Your experiment is not lost if you get warnings or fails, but it might warrant additional inspection of the reads. If you suspect something is wrong, don't hesitate to contact the sequencing provider or your favorite bioinformatician.\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nInspect all four QC reports, and discuss with your neighbour what you think about them.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n- Sample 1, 2 and 3 are actually of good quality. Only the expected module (Per base sequence content) gives a FAIL, all other modules are green!\n- For sample 4 this is not the case. The quality score of the bases is low, especially towards the end of the reads. Also, `fastqc` detected a TruSeq sequencing adapter in a small portion of the reads.\n\n:::\n\n## Trimming: `fastp`\n\nA common anomaly detected by `fastqc` is sequencing adapters still being present some of the the reads (shown in **Overrepresented sequences** table). This is known as 'adapter contamination', and the presence of these adapter sequences in the reads might affect how the reads map to the genome of interest. So, we need to get rid of them. We will use `fastp` to do this. In addition, `fastp` will trim low quality bases from the reads. Finally, it will remove reads that are overall of low quality, or are too short after the trimming steps.\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nmkdir fastp_reports\nmkdir trimmed_reads\nfastp \\ \n  -i reads/sample1.fastq.gz \\\n  -o trimmed_reads/sample4.trimmed.fastq.gz \\\n  --thread 2 \\\n  --html fastp_reports/sample4_fastp_report.html\n```\n\n`fastp` prints information about the trimming on the terminal, for example:\n\n```{bash filename=\"partial output\"}\n#| eval: false\nFiltering result:\nreads passed filter: 39343\nreads failed due to low quality: 10642\nreads failed due to too many N: 15\nreads failed due to too short: 0\nreads with adapter trimmed: 0\nbases trimmed due to adapters: 0\n```\n\nThe same information is also saved as a nice `.html` page, you can download them and have a look.\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nAfter running `fastp`, the adapter contamination of sample 4 should be gone.\n\n1. How could you check whether `fastp` indeed did it's job?\n2. Write a command to check this.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n1. We can run `fastqc` again, this time on the trimmed reads.\n2. \n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nfastqc -o fastqc_reports_trimmed trimmed_reads/sample4.trimmed.fastq.gz\n```\nBy inspecting the `.html` report of the trimmed reads, we should see that the quality of the read sets has now improved, and that it no longer detects the TruSeq adapters.\n:::\n\n## Mapping: `STAR`\n\nOur reads are now ready for mapping. Mapping reads means figuring out where each read from the RNA-seq experiment originally came from within the genome. For RNA-seq experiments, it's important to pick a **splice-aware** aligner, since a RNA-seq read can span an exon-intron-exon boundary. After all, the vast majority of RNA you sequenced is mature mRNA where introns have been spliced out. \n\n![Splice-aware vs non-splice-aware alignment (image from Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core)](../images/HBC-spliced-alignment.png)\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\" icon=\"false\"}\nSo, for RNA-seq we need splice-aware aligners. Can you come up with an experiment that would not require a splice-aware aligner program?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\nIn experiments where we don't need to think about exon-intron boundaries. This is the case when the reads originate from genomic DNA, for example for whole genome sequencing experiments, or enrichment sequencing experiments like Chip-Seq. \n:::\n\nTo use an aligner, we must first get the **reference genome** (e.g. via [NCBI Genomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/) or organism specific databases), in `.fa` or `.fasta` format. You will also need an annotation file with all the predicted gene models (`.gff` or `.gtf`format). For this workshop, the *A. thaliana* reference genome was included in the workshop materials. \n\nBefore we start mapping we need to *index* the reference genome. Indexing the genome prepares the genome in a way that allows a computer to search it efficiently. The genome, a multi-million basepair long string of text, is encoded into a different, computer-friendly datastructure such as a suffix tree. The details of this procedure are beyond the scope of this workshop, but it's important to do it. The *Arabidopsis thaliana* genome is already present in the notebook. We make the index using `STAR`:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nSTAR --runMode genomeGenerate \\\n  --genomeSAindexNbases 12 \\\n  --genomeFastaFiles genome/TAIR10.fasta \\\n  --genomeDir TAIR10_STAR_index\n```\n\nAllright, let's finally run `STAR`. This tool requires quite some parameters to be set: how many threads to use (`--runThreadN`), where to find the index (`--genomeDir`), where to find the reads (`--readFilesIn`), that the reads are compressed (`--readFilesCommand`), where to store the results (`--outFileNamePrefix`), and which output file format we want (`--outSAMtype`). Pfew.\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nSTAR \\   \n  --runThreadN 2 \\ \n  --genomeDir TAIR10_STAR_index \\\n  --readFilesIn trimmed_reads/sample1.trimmed.fastq.gz \\\n  --readFilesCommand zcat \\\n  --outFileNamePrefix mapped_reads/sample1_ \\\n  --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate\n```\n\nLet's look at a mapping summary in a file generated by STAR that ends with `.final.out`. We can do that on the command line (using `cat`), or you can download the file and open it in a text editor. \n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\ncat mapped_reads/sample1_Log.final.out\n```\n\nIt's important to check how many reads did not map to the reference genome. In our case, it looks like more than 95% of the reads mapped to the reference genome. That's good! A high proportion of unmapped reads can be a warning sign that something went wrong in your experiment or analysis. The explanations may be technical (bad read quality), bioinformatical (perhaps you used the wrong reference genome!), or biological --- it has been well documented that around 11% of primate and rodent cell-line RNA-seq datasets available on NCBI in 2015 were contaminated with mycoplasma RNA ([Olarerin-George & Hogenesch, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4357728/)). Likewise, 8,5% of all *Arabidopsis thaliana* NCBI RNA-seq datasets are contaminated with a virus that does not cause any disease symptoms, but can cover up to 80% of all reads generated in an RNA-seq experiment ([Verhoeven et al., 2022](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.18466)). That said, we don't need to aim for 100% reads mapped to the reference genome. There will always be some contamination, or your studied individual possesses genetic information not present in the reference genome. \n\n### BAM and SAM files\n\nThe mapped reads are stored in a sorted `.bam` file by `STAR`. `.sam` (and `.bam`) files keep information for each individual read and its alignment to the genome. `.sam` files do this in a tab-seperated, human readable format, while `.bam` files store the same information in a binary file format that's not readable for humans, but is much more efficient to process and store by computers. `samtools` is a widely used program to inspect and manipulate `.sam` and `.bam` files. Like many command line programs, `samtools` commands can be connected to each other via the pipe symbol `|`, and the results can be stored in a new file using the `>` symbol. \n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nUse the `head` command to inspect a `.bam` file. \n\n1. What do you see?\n2. Use `samtools view` command, piped (using `|`) into a common Unix program, to inspect the first 10 lines of the file. \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n1. \n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nhead mapped_reads/sample1_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\n```\n\nThe output looks like gibberish, because `.bam` files are a binary file format. \n\n2. You can use `samtools view` to make samtools read the binary file, and then pipe that result into the `head` function to show the first 10 lines:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nsamtools view mapped_reads/sample1_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam | head\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nUse the two following commands on a `.bam` file, and interpret the output.\n\n1. `samtools flagstat`\n2. `samtools idxstats` (Note: before running this command, you need to index the `.bam` file using `samtools index mapped_reads/sample1_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam`) \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n1. `samtools flagstat` shows us (just like the `STAR` log file) how many reads were mapped correctly. In addition, it tells us whether read pairs (if mapping paired-end data) mapped together as expected (are 'properly paired'). Today, we used single-end reads so this is not relavant.\n2. `samtools idxstats` shows us how many reads were mapped to each chromosome of the reference genome. This is useful to confirm whether the entire genome is evenly covered, or that there may be overrepresentation on e.g. the mitochondrial DNA.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nSo far, we only trimmed and mapped one sample. Write two `bash` for loops to process all four samples.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n1. For loop to trim:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nfor sample in reads/*.fastq.gz\ndo\n  name=$(basename \"$sample\" .fastq.gz)\n  echo \"processing ${name}\"\n\n  fastp \\\n  -i reads/${name}.fastq.gz \\\n  -o trimmed_reads/${name}.trimmed.fastq.gz \\\n  --thread 2 \\\n  --html fastp_reports/${name}_fastp_report.html\ndone\n```\n\n2. For loop to map:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nfor sample in trimmed_reads/*.trimmed.fastq.gz\ndo\n  name=$(basename \"$sample\" .trimmed.fastq.gz)\n\n  software/STAR \\\n    --runThreadN 2 \\\n    --genomeDir TAIR10_STAR_index \\\n    --readFilesIn reads/${name}.trimmed.fastq.gz \\\n    --readFilesCommand zcat \\\n    --outFileNamePrefix mapped_reads/${name}_ \\\n    --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate\ndone\n```\n:::\n\n### Inspecting the mapping on a genome browser\n\nSo far, these steps may have been quite abstract. Let's make it more visual. We will look at our mapped reads in a genome browser. \n\n1. Download a `.bam` file with accompanying `.bam.bai` index file.\n2. Go to [the Arabidopsis page on Phytozome](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Athaliana_TAIR10) (or another website for your favorite organism).\n3. Click `JBrowse`.\n4. Go to `File` > `Open track file or URL` > `Select Files...` to find your files.\n5. Click `Open`!\n\n![](../images/alignment_arabidopsis.png)\n\nThat's wonderful! You should see red and blue (forward and reverse) blocks aligning with the exons of the annotated gene models of *A. thaliana*. Also notice that some reads will be beautifully split over two or more introns. Good RNA-seq mapping should align predominantly to exons. If this is not the case, something might be wrong. For example, your RNA sample could have been contaminated with genomic DNA. Another option that could explain mappings to non-annotated regions of the genome, is that the annotation may not be complete. \n\nObviously, we can't manually inspect all samples and all genes like this, so we will need to count the number of reads in each in gene in each sample. We will do that in the next and final step of today.\n\n## Counting: `featureCounts`\n\nThe `featureCounts` program will .... count (!) the number of reads that map within an annotated feature. Here, we chose to aggregate read count by gene (`-t gene`). Alternative options are transcript and exon (but they may require a different formatting of the annotation file).\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nfeatureCounts \\\n  -T 2 \\\n  -O \\\n  -a genome/TAIR10_GFF3_genes.gff \\\n  -o counts.tsv \\\n  -t gene \\\n  mapped_reads/*.bam\n```\n\nWhile running, `featureCounts` shows how many mapped reads were assigned to features. Finally, let's look at the counts table that was generated:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nhead counts.tsv\n\n# Program:featureCounts v2.0.3; Command:\"featureCounts\" \"-T\" \"2\" \"-O\" \"-a\" \"genome/TAIR10_GFF3_genes.gff\" \"-o\" \"raw_counts.tsv\" \"-t\" \"gene\" \"mapped_reads/sample1_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\" \"mapped_reads/sample2_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\" \"mapped_reads/sample3_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\" \"mapped_reads/sample4_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\" \nGeneid\tChr\tStart\tEnd\tStrand\tLength\tmapped_reads/sample1_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\tmapped_reads/sample2_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\tmapped_reads/sample3_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\tmapped_reads/sample4_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\nAT1G01010\t1\t3631\t5899\t+\t2269\t0\t0\t0\t0\nAT1G01020\t1\t5928\t8737\t-\t2810\t0\t0\t2\t0\nAT1G01030\t1\t11649\t13714\t-\t2066\t0\t0\t0\t0\nAT1G01040\t1\t23146\t31227\t+\t8082\t5\t5\t3\t1\nAT1G01046\t1\t28500\t28706\t+\t207\t0\t0\t0\t0\nAT1G01050\t1\t31170\t33153\t-\t1984\t3\t6\t4\t0\nAT1G01060\t1\t33379\t37871\t-\t4493\t1\t2\t2\t0\nAT1G01070\t1\t38752\t40944\t-\t2193\t1\t0\t0\t0\n```\n\nThe first row records the specific `featureCounts` command that we used to make this table. Ech subsequent row corresponds to a `Geneid`. The first six columns provide gene metadata: geneid, chromosome, start and end coordinates, strand, and gene length. All remaining columns contain the read counts of each sample.\n\n## A note on the specific tools used here\n\nIn bioinformatics, there are often many ways to reach the same goal. Here we have selected mapping, trimming and counting tools that we have available and have experience with, but there are many others that perform just as well. The following table highlights a few popular alternative options:\n\n| Task | Tool used here | Alternative tools |\n| ---- | -------------- | ----------------- |\n| Trimming | `fastp` | `cutadapt`, `trimmomatic` |\n| Mapping | `STAR` | `HISAT2` |\n| Counting | `featureCounts` | `StringTie` |\n\nInstead of real base-to-base read mapping using `STAR` or `HISAT2`, you can also consider *quasi-mapping* your reads to just the annotated transcript models using `salmon`. This is much faster and requires less storage space than real mapping, but for educational purposes and smaller scale experiments, true mapping is still more insightful. \n\n## Streamlining read mapping procedure\n\nIf you find this process quite cumbersome, then I have good news for you! There are *pipelines* available that streamline the chain of commands required for mapping:\n\n- [snakemake_rnaseq](https://github.com/BleekerLab/snakemake_rnaseq), developed at the Bleeker Lab (UvA).\n- [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.19.0), developed and maintained by the Nextflow community.\n- **TODO**: GALAXY server information here\n\nA full instruction of these pipelines is beyond the scope of this workshop. Also, we wish to highlight that it is *very insightful* to have run all the steps by yourself rather than in a pipeline.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n![](../images/flow-chart-RNA-Seq-2.png)\n\nThe moment is there: you received the FASTQ files from your sequencing provider! .... now what?\n\nThe `.fastq` files contain your RNA sequencing reads. Our goal is to find out from which genes these reads originate, and whether there are differentially expressed genes between your experimental factors. Before doing that, we need to make sure that the sequencing reads are of good quality, a process called quality control (QC). Additionally, no matter how good the overall quality of the sequencing data is, we will also 'trim' our reads to remove bad quality reads and sequencing adapters that may still be present in the sample. So, to summarize, we will do the following steps in this episode:\n\n1. Quality control: is my sequencing data of *good quality*?\n2. Trimming: removing bad quality reads and sequencing adapters\n3.

We will use some basic terminal commands. You don't need to understand every command, rather, the goal is to become familiar with RNA-seq concepts and steps.\n\n## Quality control: `fastqc`\n\nThe first step in the RNA-seq workflow is to assess the quality of the sequencing reads. Sequence reads generated from next-generation sequencing technologies come in the FASTQ file format. This file format evolved from FASTA: it contains sequence data, but also contains quality information. For a single record (sequence read) there are four lines, each of which are described below:\n\n|Line|Description|\n|----|-----------|\n|1|Always begins with '@' and then information about the read|\n|2|The actual DNA sequence|\n|3|Always begins with a '+' and sometimes the same info in line 1|\n|4|Has a string of characters which represent the quality scores; must have same number of characters as line 2|\n\nLet's look at one read. Note that our `.fastq` files are compressed: they have extension `.fastq.gz`. Most bioinformatics programs can deal with compressed file, so we don't need to uncompress them. To have a look at a compressed file on the command line, we can use `zcat` and then pipe (`|`) the result into the `head` function to display the first 4 lines:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nzcat reads/sample1.fastq.gz | head -n 4\n\n@ERR1406259.2 HWI-ST1034:108:D1HW4ACXX:1:1101:1627:2208/1\nCCGAAACAATCTCTCTCTCGTCGCCGGAAGCAAAAGAAGAATTAAGATAAGCCTCATCCATCCAGTGATGCAAATCACCAACCCATATGGTTTTATTCTCA\n+\nCCCFFFFFHHHHHJJJIJJGIIIJJJFJJJJJJJIJIIGIIIJJJHIJJJHGHHHFFEFFFEDEEACDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDED4@BDDDDDEDC\n```\n\nThe fourth line of each read represent the quality score of each basecall, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score#Symbols) for more info. `fastqc` will use these characters to quantify the quality your read set.\n\nLet's run `fastqc` on one sample:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nmkdir fastqc_reports # <1>\nfastqc -o fastqc_reports reads/sample1.fastq.gz # <2>\n```\n\n1. First we make a directory (`mkdir`) to store the `fastqc` reports.\n2. We call the `fastqc` program, tell it to store the output in the fastqc_reports directory, and tell it which sample to use.\n\nYou'll see that `fastqc` created a `.html` page in the `fastqc_reports` directory. We'll inspect it later.\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nRun `fastqc` on another sample.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\nTo do this, we need to replace the input filename.\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nfastqc -o fastqc_reports reads/sample2.fastq.gz\n```\n:::\n\nDoing this manually for every sample would be quite tiring, especially when we would have many samples.

Here we define a variable `sample` that will subsequently get the values of all datasets matching the `reads/*.fastq.gz` statement, where `*` acts as a wildcard.\n2. `do` (and later `done`) define the start and the end of the for loop, respectively.\n2. Here we add the actual command that will be repeated for each sample, where `$sample` will subsequently be filled in with all of our four filenames.\n\n`fastq` generates reports of each sample in `.html` and `.zip` format:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nls fastqc_reports # <1>\n\nsample1_fastqc.html  sample2_fastqc.zip   sample4_fastqc.html\nsample1_fastqc.zip   sample3_fastqc.html  sample4_fastqc.zip\nsample2_fastqc.html  sample3_fastqc.zip\n```\n1. `ls` is a command to 'list' all the files present in a directory.\n\nFinally, let's inspect the QC results. If you are working in the Google Colab, you can browse the files in the workspace by clicking the directory symbol. Find `fastqc_reports` and download the `.html` files. You can open these in any browser. `fastqc` gives teach dataset a score (Pass, Warning, or Fail) on several different modules. All scores are reported in the **Summary**. The next section contains basic statistics like the number of reads, average sequence length, and the GC content. Generally it is a good idea to keep track of the total number of reads sequenced for each sample and to make sure the read length and GC content is as expected (based on what you know of your studied organism). One of the most important analysis modules is the **“Per base sequence quality”** plot. This plot provides the distribution of quality scores at each position in the read across all reads. This plot can alert us to whether there were any problems occuring during sequencing. For example, see a good and bad quality result below:\n\n![](../images/fastqc-good-bad.png)\n\nOther modules are discussed in detail [here](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-salmon/lessons/qc_fastqc_assessment.html). Note that nearly all sequencing datasets will show yellow warnings or red fails: `fastqc` is quite conservative. Additionally, the module \"Per base sequence content\" very often fails for RNA-seq data, as a result of RNA-seq library prep. Your experiment is not lost if you get warnings or fails, but it might warrant additional inspection of the reads. If you suspect something is wrong, don't hesitate to contact the sequencing provider or your favorite bioinformatician.\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nInspect all four QC reports, and discuss with your neighbour what you think about them.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n- Sample 1, 2 and 3 are actually of good quality. Only the expected module (Per base sequence content) gives a FAIL, all other modules are green!\n- For sample 4 this is not the case. The quality score of the bases is low, especially towards the end of the reads. Also, `fastqc` detected a TruSeq sequencing adapter in a small portion of the reads.\n\n:::\n\n## Trimming: `fastp`\n\nA common anomaly detected by `fastqc` is sequencing adapters still being present some of the the reads (shown in **Overrepresented sequences** table). This is known as 'adapter contamination', and the presence of these adapter sequences in the reads might affect how the reads map to the genome of interest. So, we need to get rid of them. We will use `fastp` to do this. In addition, `fastp` will trim low quality bases from the reads. Finally, it will remove reads that are overall of low quality, or are too short after the trimming steps.\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nmkdir fastp_reports\nmkdir trimmed_reads\nfastp \\ \n  -i reads/sample1.fastq.gz \\\n  -o trimmed_reads/sample4.trimmed.fastq.gz \\\n  --thread 2 \\\n  --html fastp_reports/sample4_fastp_report.html\n```\n\n`fastp` prints information about the trimming on the terminal, for example:\n\n```{bash filename=\"partial output\"}\n#| eval: false\nFiltering result:\nreads passed filter: 39343\nreads failed due to low quality: 10642\nreads failed due to too many N: 15\nreads failed due to too short: 0\nreads with adapter trimmed: 0\nbases trimmed due to adapters: 0\n```\n\nThe same information is also saved as a nice `.html` page, you can download them and have a look.\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nAfter running `fastp`, the adapter contamination of sample 4 should be gone.\n\n1. How could you check whether `fastp` indeed did it's job?\n2. Write a command to check this.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n1. We can run `fastqc` again, this time on the trimmed reads.\n2. \n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nfastqc -o fastqc_reports_trimmed trimmed_reads/sample4.trimmed.fastq.gz\n```\nBy inspecting the `.html` report of the trimmed reads, we should see that the quality of the read sets has now improved, and that it no longer detects the TruSeq adapters.\n:::\n\n## Mapping: `STAR`\n\nOur reads are now ready for mapping. Mapping reads means figuring out where each read from the RNA-seq experiment originally came from within the genome. For RNA-seq experiments, it's important to pick a **splice-aware** aligner, since a RNA-seq read can span an exon-intron-exon boundary. After all, the vast majority of RNA you sequenced is mature mRNA where introns have been spliced out. \n\n![Splice-aware vs non-splice-aware alignment (image from Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core)](../images/HBC-spliced-alignment.png)\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\" icon=\"false\"}\nSo, for RNA-seq we need splice-aware aligners. Can you come up with an experiment that would not require a splice-aware aligner program?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\nIn experiments where we don't need to think about exon-intron boundaries. This is the case when the reads originate from genomic DNA, for example for whole genome sequencing experiments, or enrichment sequencing experiments like Chip-Seq. \n:::\n\nTo use an aligner, we must first get the **reference genome** (e.g. via [NCBI Genomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/) or organism specific databases), in `.fa` or `.fasta` format. You will also need an annotation file with all the predicted gene models (`.gff` or `.gtf`format). For this workshop, the *A. thaliana* reference genome was included in the workshop materials. \n\nBefore we start mapping we need to *index* the reference genome. Indexing the genome prepares the genome in a way that allows a computer to search it efficiently. The genome, a multi-million basepair long string of text, is encoded into a different, computer-friendly datastructure such as a suffix tree. The details of this procedure are beyond the scope of this workshop, but it's important to do it. The *Arabidopsis thaliana* genome is already present in the notebook. We make the index using `STAR`:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nSTAR --runMode genomeGenerate \\\n  --genomeSAindexNbases 12 \\\n  --genomeFastaFiles genome/TAIR10.fasta \\\n  --genomeDir TAIR10_STAR_index\n```\n\nAllright, let's finally run `STAR`. This tool requires quite some parameters to be set: how many threads to use (`--runThreadN`), where to find the index (`--genomeDir`), where to find the reads (`--readFilesIn`), that the reads are compressed (`--readFilesCommand`), where to store the results (`--outFileNamePrefix`), and which output file format we want (`--outSAMtype`). Pfew.\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nSTAR \\   \n  --runThreadN 2 \\ \n  --genomeDir TAIR10_STAR_index \\\n  --readFilesIn trimmed_reads/sample1.trimmed.fastq.gz \\\n  --readFilesCommand zcat \\\n  --outFileNamePrefix mapped_reads/sample1_ \\\n  --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate\n```\n\nLet's look at a mapping summary in a file generated by STAR that ends with `.final.out`. We can do that on the command line (using `cat`), or you can download the file and open it in a text editor. \n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\ncat mapped_reads/sample1_Log.final.out\n```\n\nIt's important to check how many reads did not map to the reference genome. In our case, it looks like more than 95% of the reads mapped to the reference genome. That's good! A high proportion of unmapped reads can be a warning sign that something went wrong in your experiment or analysis. The explanations may be technical (bad read quality), bioinformatical (perhaps you used the wrong reference genome!), or biological --- it has been well documented that around 11% of primate and rodent cell-line RNA-seq datasets available on NCBI in 2015 were contaminated with mycoplasma RNA ([Olarerin-George & Hogenesch, 2015](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4357728/)). Likewise, 8,5% of all *Arabidopsis thaliana* NCBI RNA-seq datasets are contaminated with a virus that does not cause any disease symptoms, but can cover up to 80% of all reads generated in an RNA-seq experiment ([Verhoeven et al., 2022](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.18466)). That said, we don't need to aim for 100% reads mapped to the reference genome. There will always be some contamination, or your studied individual possesses genetic information not present in the reference genome. \n\n### BAM and SAM files\n\nThe mapped reads are stored in a sorted `.bam` file by `STAR`. `.sam` (and `.bam`) files keep information for each individual read and its alignment to the genome. `.sam` files do this in a tab-seperated, human readable format, while `.bam` files store the same information in a binary file format that's not readable for humans, but is much more efficient to process and store by computers. `samtools` is a widely used program to inspect and manipulate `.sam` and `.bam` files. Like many command line programs, `samtools` commands can be connected to each other via the pipe symbol `|`, and the results can be stored in a new file using the `>` symbol. \n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nUse the `head` command to inspect a `.bam` file. \n\n1. What do you see?\n2. Use `samtools view` command, piped (using `|`) into a common Unix program, to inspect the first 10 lines of the file. \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n1. \n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nhead mapped_reads/sample1_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\n```\n\nThe output looks like gibberish, because `.bam` files are a binary file format. \n\n2. You can use `samtools view` to make samtools read the binary file, and then pipe that result into the `head` function to show the first 10 lines:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nsamtools view mapped_reads/sample1_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam | head\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nUse the two following commands on a `.bam` file, and interpret the output.\n\n1. `samtools flagstat`\n2. `samtools idxstats` (Note: before running this command, you need to index the `.bam` file using `samtools index mapped_reads/sample1_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam`) \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n1. `samtools flagstat` shows us (just like the `STAR` log file) how many reads were mapped correctly. In addition, it tells us whether read pairs (if mapping paired-end data) mapped together as expected (are 'properly paired'). Today, we used single-end reads so this is not relavant.\n2. `samtools idxstats` shows us how many reads were mapped to each chromosome of the reference genome. This is useful to confirm whether the entire genome is evenly covered, or that there may be overrepresentation on e.g. the mitochondrial DNA.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Exercise\" icon=\"false\"}\nSo far, we only trimmed and mapped one sample. Write two `bash` for loops to process all four samples.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Solution\" collapse=\"true\" icon=\"false\"}\n\n1. For loop to trim:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nfor sample in reads/*.fastq.gz\ndo\n  name=$(basename \"$sample\" .fastq.gz)\n  echo \"processing ${name}\"\n\n  fastp \\\n  -i reads/${name}.fastq.gz \\\n  -o trimmed_reads/${name}.trimmed.fastq.gz \\\n  --thread 2 \\\n  --html fastp_reports/${name}_fastp_report.html\ndone\n```\n\n2. For loop to map:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nfor sample in trimmed_reads/*.trimmed.fastq.gz\ndo\n  name=$(basename \"$sample\" .trimmed.fastq.gz)\n\n  software/STAR \\\n    --runThreadN 2 \\\n    --genomeDir TAIR10_STAR_index \\\n    --readFilesIn reads/${name}.trimmed.fastq.gz \\\n    --readFilesCommand zcat \\\n    --outFileNamePrefix mapped_reads/${name}_ \\\n    --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate\ndone\n```\n:::\n\n### Inspecting the mapping on a genome browser\n\nSo far, these steps may have been quite abstract. Let's make it more visual. We will look at our mapped reads in a genome browser. \n\n1. Download a `.bam` file with accompanying `.bam.bai` index file.\n2. Go to [the Arabidopsis page on Phytozome](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Athaliana_TAIR10) (or another website for your favorite organism).\n3. Click `JBrowse`.\n4. Go to `File` > `Open track file or URL` > `Select Files...` to find your files.\n5. Click `Open`!\n\n![](../images/alignment_arabidopsis.png)\n\nThat's wonderful! You should see red and blue (forward and reverse) blocks aligning with the exons of the annotated gene models of *A. thaliana*. Also notice that some reads will be beautifully split over two or more introns. Good RNA-seq mapping should align predominantly to exons. If this is not the case, something might be wrong. For example, your RNA sample could have been contaminated with genomic DNA. Another option that could explain mappings to non-annotated regions of the genome, is that the annotation may not be complete. \n\nObviously, we can't manually inspect all samples and all genes like this, so we will need to count the number of reads in each in gene in each sample. We will do that in the next and final step of today.\n\n## Counting: `featureCounts`\n\nThe `featureCounts` program will .... count (!) the number of reads that map within an annotated feature. Here, we chose to aggregate read count by gene (`-t gene`). Alternative options are transcript and exon (but they may require a different formatting of the annotation file).\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nfeatureCounts \\\n  -T 2 \\\n  -O \\\n  -a genome/TAIR10_GFF3_genes.gff \\\n  -o counts.tsv \\\n  -t gene \\\n  mapped_reads/*.bam\n```\n\nWhile running, `featureCounts` shows how many mapped reads were assigned to features. Finally, let's look at the counts table that was generated:\n\n```{bash filename=\"bash\"}\n#| eval: false\nhead counts.tsv\n\n# Program:featureCounts v2.0.3; Command:\"featureCounts\" \"-T\" \"2\" \"-O\" \"-a\" \"genome/TAIR10_GFF3_genes.gff\" \"-o\" \"raw_counts.tsv\" \"-t\" \"gene\" \"mapped_reads/sample1_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\" \"mapped_reads/sample2_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\" \"mapped_reads/sample3_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\" \"mapped_reads/sample4_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\" \nGeneid\tChr\tStart\tEnd\tStrand\tLength\tmapped_reads/sample1_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\tmapped_reads/sample2_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\tmapped_reads/sample3_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\tmapped_reads/sample4_Aligned.sortedByCoord.out.bam\nAT1G01010\t1\t3631\t5899\t+\t2269\t0\t0\t0\t0\nAT1G01020\t1\t5928\t8737\t-\t2810\t0\t0\t2\t0\nAT1G01030\t1\t11649\t13714\t-\t2066\t0\t0\t0\t0\nAT1G01040\t1\t23146\t31227\t+\t8082\t5\t5\t3\t1\nAT1G01046\t1\t28500\t28706\t+\t207\t0\t0\t0\t0\nAT1G01050\t1\t31170\t33153\t-\t1984\t3\t6\t4\t0\nAT1G01060\t1\t33379\t37871\t-\t4493\t1\t2\t2\t0\nAT1G01070\t1\t38752\t40944\t-\t2193\t1\t0\t0\t0\n```\n\nThe first row records the specific `featureCounts` command that we used to make this table. Ech subsequent row corresponds to a `Geneid`. The first six columns provide gene metadata: geneid, chromosome, start and end coordinates, strand, and gene length. All remaining columns contain the read counts of each sample.\n\n## A note on the specific tools used here\n\nIn bioinformatics, there are often many ways to reach the same goal. Here we have selected mapping, trimming and counting tools that we have available and have experience with, but there are many others that perform just as well. The following table highlights a few popular alternative options:\n\n| Task | Tool used here | Alternative tools |\n| ---- | -------------- | ----------------- |\n| Trimming | `fastp` | `cutadapt`, `trimmomatic` |\n| Mapping | `STAR` | `HISAT2` |\n| Counting | `featureCounts` | `StringTie` |\n\nInstead of real base-to-base read mapping using `STAR` or `HISAT2`, you can also consider *quasi-mapping* your reads to just the annotated transcript models using `salmon`. This is much faster and requires less storage space than real mapping, but for educational purposes and smaller scale experiments, true mapping is still more insightful. \n\n## Streamlining read mapping procedure\n\nIf you find this process quite cumbersome, then I have good news for you! There are *pipelines* available that streamline the chain of commands required for mapping:\n\n- [snakemake_rnaseq](https://github.com/BleekerLab/snakemake_rnaseq), developed at the Bleeker Lab (UvA).\n- [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.19.0), developed and maintained by the Nextflow community.\n- **TODO**: GALAXY server information here\n\nA full instruction of these pipelines is beyond the scope of this workshop. Also, we wish to highlight that it is *very insightful* to have run all the steps by yourself rather than in a pipeline."},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":5,"fig-height":4,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"03-mapping-reads.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
